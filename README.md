Authors: Iosif Mondoc and Patricia Paredes Mart√≠n

Subject: Network Intelligence


The chatbot design is set up on a virtual Movistar technical support assistant that helps users to solve the most frequent breakdowns/incidents through a series of choices that will detect the specific problem. In this way, a possible solution would be given to each singular problem.
All the project was developed on Dialogflow.
